# beautyclinic-gis
Currently developing a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) as part of a research project (pre-thesis), focused on mapping beauty clinic locations across Jambi City. The system is designed to support spatial data visualization, improve clinic accessibility insights, and enhance decision-making through interactive map interfaces.
